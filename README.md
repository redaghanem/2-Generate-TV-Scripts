 2- Generate TV Scripts Project is a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

## What is it?
This project generates Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs.  

Udacity provided part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.   

Sample generated script:
